Test Driven Development 

* System Configuration

* How to Setup Notification in Jenkins.

* How to integrade with Docker, kubernetest, github action and AWS.
* How to Run Freestyle Job to deploy projects.
* How to make pipelines Declarative and Scripted.


* Setting Up a Build Agent.
    * create ssh key 
    * put here /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/authorize_keys 
    * install java handless 
    * go back to jenkins master to setup 
    * copy rsa.private key and create cred

* Configuration Build 
* setup scm in Build
* Tesing and test Reports 
* Building git with jenkins
* artifact and fingerprint 
* Linking Jobs 
* Job Automation 

* using the jenkins api 
* using the jenkins cli 


-> Jenkins pipeline
* pipeline Jobs run basic pipeline
* The Blue Ocean editor 
* Scripted vs Declarative pipeline 
    * Scripted pipeline -> we can use logic. start with node {}
    * Declarative pipeline -> we can not use logic.start with pipeline {}
* Groovy Vs DSL
    * Groovy -> is a programming langauage 
    * DSL -> is a domain specific langauage 
* Automation pipeline
    * Jenkinsfile Basic 
    * pipeline Trigger -> we can trigger pipeline by webhook, cron, other job etc.
    * multi branch pipeline => 
       * How to setup webhook in multi branch pipeline 
        * use this function 
        * trigger {
            githubPush() # 
        }

* Adavanced Jenkinsfile 
    * Global Libraries -> @Libraries() _
        * Folder Level Libraries - >  @Libraries() _ , more secure compare to Global Libraries
        * Global Level Libraries ->     they don't run on sandbox 
    * Variable and Credential 
        * Variable to decleare 
            ronment {
                var='value' # inside the stage block it called local Variable.
            }

* How to Use Docker with Jenkins.
    * install Docker on master node 
    *  we neet plugins  -> docker , docker pipeline . docker comman.


Updates -:
Learning -: 
learn about Variable(global and local) and Credential.
learn about Jenkinsfile Basic.
learn about plugins.
Use Declarative pipeline and run Basic pipelines on jenkins.
Run docker agent thought the pipeline.
pipeline Trigger using webhook.



===> Today <===
build benji 
jenkins upstream and downstream
ARM and AMD 
Jenkins upgrade 
------><-----------
Linking multiple Freestyle pipeline upstream and downstream.
Jenkins integration with docker,kubernetest,EKS,ECR. -> connect with RDS. 
use to deploy local, dev,prod,test.

* Linking Jobs -> Freestyle job provide durabilty.
 link job 
    * f1 -> f2 -> f3 .





* 
Updates -:
Learning -:  
Worked on setting up Docker login and push through Jenkins freestyle jobs.
Added Docker Hub credentials into Jenkins using Username with Password type.
General Meeting -: 
Connected with @Nikhil sir for the inpowered overview.
Connected with @Harshal sir regarding Jenkins-related issues(Variable pass to Jobs).

Can you please start two temporary machines in the region closest to this location, and share a screenshot of the ping, please?

US West
Hillsboro OR 97124
USW: 192.208.222.110

US East
Reston, VA 20191
USE: 69.194.240.11

[3:34 AM]
I guess the regions we should choose are:
Hillsboro, OR → San Jose (us-sanjose-1)
Reston, VA → Ashburn (us-ashburn-1)
But please double-check this.
